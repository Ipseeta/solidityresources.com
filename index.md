# Solidity

When you think of Ethereum, you probably come across the term smart-contracts. The high-level language to implement smart contracts is Solidity. It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Getting Started

### Wallets
You want to start by getting yourself set up with a wallet. You have a number of choices:

#### Desktop wallets:-

- [Mist Wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) an official Ethereum wallet
- Get [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension for your browser
- [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/) is the world’s first multi-cryptocurrency desktop wallet. It is free to use and has an attractive UI.

#### Hardware wallets:-

- [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) is a Bitcoin, Ethereum and Altcoins hardware wallet, based on robust safety features for storing cryptographic assets and securing digital payments. It connects to any computer (USB) and embeds a secure OLED display to double-check and confirm each transaction with a single tap on its side buttons.
- [Trezor](https://www.amazon.com/TREZOR-The-Bitcoin-Safe-Black/dp/B00R6MKDDE) provides you with a safe payment option and also provides you with the most trusted and secure way to store your bitcoins.
- [KeepKey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0143M2A5S/) is the costliest Ethereum hardware wallet available ($129). It keeps your ETH in a secure offline environment and offers the same features as the Ledger Nano S or Trezor.

#### Mobile wallets:-
