# Solidity Resources

## Wallets
You want to start by getting yourself set up with a wallet. You have a number of choices:

### Desktop wallets:-

- [Mist Wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) an official Ethereum wallet
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Get [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension for your browser
- [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/) is the world‚Äôs first multi-cryptocurrency desktop wallet. It is free to use and has an attractive UI.

### Hardware wallets:-

- [Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) is a Bitcoin, Ethereum and Altcoins hardware wallet, based on robust safety features for storing cryptographic assets and securing digital payments. It connects to any computer (USB) and embeds a secure OLED display to double-check and confirm each transaction with a single tap on its side buttons.
- [Trezor](https://www.amazon.com/TREZOR-The-Bitcoin-Safe-Black/dp/B00R6MKDDE) provides you with a safe payment option and also provides you with the most trusted and secure way to store your bitcoins.
- [KeepKey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0143M2A5S/) is the costliest Ethereum hardware wallet available ($129). It keeps your ETH in a secure offline environment and offers the same features as the Ledger Nano S or Trezor.

### Mobile wallets:-

- [Bitcoin Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schildbach.wallet) is the first mobile Bitcoin app, and arguably also the most secure.
- [Breadwallet](https://breadapp.com/) - Intuitive and secure, breadwallet gives you complete control over your bitcoin.
- [Jaxx](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kryptokit.jaxx) an independent Bitcoin wallet that‚Äôs available for most devices&nbsp;(Windows, Apple and Linux desktop, Android and iOS mobile and tablet, and Google Chrome and Firefox extensions.)

### Web wallets:-

- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/home) is a secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring, and storing digital currency.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/), where you control Ethereum‚Äôs private key on your machine.
- [GreenAddress](https://greenaddress.it/en/) is a bitcoin wallet with a web interface that is also available for desktop, iOS, and Android.
